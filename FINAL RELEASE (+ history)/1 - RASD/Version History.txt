Version 1.0 -> 2.0 ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

Minor fixes in the goals (just rephrasing).

The requirement R11f has been reviewed clarifying that the user should not have any other session opened when a car is reserved.

The Alloy models have been added directly into the document instead of keeping them as separate files.

The car’s state chart has been changed as the state ‘reservable’ has been changed in ‘not reserved’ and ‘not reservable’ in ‘reserved’. The nodes have been labeled accordingly.

Added the tools used and the hours of work.


Version 2.0 -> 2.1 ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

In the latter version it is the car that autonomously sends the most up-to-date data and the system stores them with a timestamp associated.
See requirements R17f R19f R20f.

The requirement R30f has been modified, when a transaction request is triggered, our system sets the user as not owing and sets him(her) back to not owing only when the payment system provides a positive feedback. Our system does not frequently query the payment system (to set the user as not owing) anymore.

The requirement R31n is consequently useless and has been deleted then.


Version 2.1 -> 3.0 ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————

The assumption A|g01 has been clarified and made tighter (and stronger) in order to supply the management of the exceptions and data management.
